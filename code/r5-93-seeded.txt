# r5-93-seeded.txt - run case file for MatrixMult22.py.

# General options - size of problem, random seed, number of solves and output options.

MATRIX_SIZE: 5 # Integer value >=2, <=8, required.
RANDOM_SEED: 3161794629 # AUTO or integer value up to 10 digits, required.
NUMBER_OF_SOLVES: 100 # Integer value >0, required.
PRINT_OUTPUT: STANDARD # NONE or SUMMARY or STANDARD or DETAILED or DIAGNOSTIC, required.
SCHEME_STYLE: FULL # FULL or SUMMARY, required.
WRITE_LOG: YES # YES (writes to runlog.txt) or NO, required.

# Definition - if a NEW run, specify either DIAGONAL_CUBES or FULL_CUBES or neither.  
# These are used to specify the degenerate cube (A=B=C) multiplications.  DIAGONAL_CUBES just
# include the diagonal A11*B11*C11, A22*B22*C22 etc. terms and the set must include all
# the diagonal terms. FULL_CUBES includes all terms including e.g.
# A12*B12*C12, but such off-diagonal terms must cancel out in the set as a whole.
# If neither FULL_CUBES or DIAGONAL_CUBES is specified, the individual diagonal cubes will
# be triplicated to avoid the degeneracy - this will not work with 6-way symmetry for odd matrix size.
# If a CONTINUATION run, specify either SAVED_FILE (specified file name in the results folder) or 
# SAVED_SIZE (if a value is given, a random saved file of that size is chosen, 
# if RANDOM is specified, a random file is chosen from the results folder). 
# To SAVE - specify either ALL, which will overwrite the start point if no improvement
# or save a new file if an improvement.  Or give an integer value, and a scheme will be saved if 
# less than or equal to this value. All schemes are saved in a subfolder, results.

RUN_TYPE: NEW # NEW or CONTINUATION, required.
TARGET: 93 # Integer value, required.
SAVE: 93 # ALL or integer value, required.
SYMMETRY: 3 # Integer value 3 or 6, required.
DIAGONAL_CUBES: 10001 01010 00100 # List of binary values of length MATRIX_SIZE, optional.
# FULL_CUBES: <list of binary values> # List of binary values of length MATRIX_SIZE**2, optional.
# SAVED_FILE: <filename> # File name (string), optional. 
# SAVED_SIZE: <value> # RANDOM or integer value, optional. 

# Flip limit - maximum number of flips allowed, if TERMINATION_STRATEGY is set to LIMIT, it will terminate on 
# reaching the flip limit, if set to EARLY, it will terminate if there is deemed small chance of 
# getting the flips needed to reach the target, if set to RESET, every new lowest rank,
# the limit is changed to the current flips plus the flip limit.  

FLIP_LIMIT: 100000000 # Integer value >0, required.
TERMINATION_STRATEGY: RESET # LIMIT, EARLY or RESET, required.

# Plus transitions - specify the number of flips after which a plus transition will be made,
# the limit is the maximum rank allowed, which can be above the start rank which can be useful if 
# restarting from a saved solution. A limit of zero is taken to be the start rank. Plus transitions
# are equally spaced unless specified to be random.

PLUS_TRANSITION_AFTER: 50000 # Integer value, 0 means no plus transitions, required.
PLUS_TRANSITION_LIMIT: 0 # Integer value, required.
PLUS_TRANSITION_RANDOM: NO # YES or NO, required.

# Maximum size - it is possible to limit the size of the multiplications in the set, 
# to either a limit on the length of non-zero A, B or C, or a limit on the 'cuboid volume' A*B*C.

MAXIMUM_SIZE: NONE # NONE or LENGTH and integer value >0 or VOLUME and integer value >0, required.
